# 420 - Project Locations

## Overview

Code projects are stored across two main locations on this system:

1. `~/dev/` - Active local development
2. `~/media/Code/` - Long-term project storage and archives

Everything in /media/Code should be moved to /dev eventually for active development.

## ~/dev Directory

### Structure

```text
~/dev/
├── dev.code-workspace    # VS Code workspace file
└── notes/                # This documentation workspace
```
