# TODO List

## Usability

- [ ] Autostart apps
- [ ] Assign apps to start at certain positions
- [ ] Default workspace configurations
- [ ] Quickstart app keybindings

## Ricing

- [ ] Make Todo list for ricing tasks
- [ ] Replace all flatpak installs with native packages (Flatpak causes DBus/sandboxing issues with X11/i3. Native packages are simpler and more reliable. Never install with flatpak again.)

## Server Setup

- [ ] Create permanent connection from this machine to my home server for file sync and remote access
  - [ ] Set up SSH keys for passwordless login
  - [ ] Configure `rclone` for syncing specific directories
  - [ ] Set up VPN or SSH tunnel for secure remote access
- [ ] un-fuck current server configurations
- [ ] Document server setup and configurations
